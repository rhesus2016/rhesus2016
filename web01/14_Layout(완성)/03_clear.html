			<h1>Kings Man: The Secret Service</h1>
			<p class="p1">Kingsman: The Secret Service is a spy action-comedy film[5] directed by Matthew Vaughn, and based on the comic book The Secret Service, created by Dave Gibbons and Mark Millar. The screenplay was written by Vaughn and Jane Goldman. It follows the recruitment and training of a potential secret agent, Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton), into a secret spy organisation. Eggsy joins a mission to tackle a global threat from Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a wealthy megalomaniac. The film also stars Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Michael Caine.</p>
			<p class="p2">Kingsman: The Secret Service premiered at the annual film marathon Butt-Numb-A-Thon on 13 December 2014, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2015. The film received generally positive reviews from critics who highly praised the stylized action sequences, the acting performances, villain, score, and its black humor. The film has grossed over $414 million worldwide, becoming Vaughn's most commercially successful film to date.[6] In 2015 it won the Empire Award for Best British Film.</p>
			<p class="p3">Following the film's success, a sequel, titled Kingsman: The Golden Circle, is scheduled for a 22 September 2017 release, with Vaughn returning to direct.</p>
